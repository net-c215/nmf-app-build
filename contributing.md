# üëê Contributing

So you want to contribute to the app? Great! Please read the following instructions to avoid any confusion. Working with many people on a single project can be a challenge, it can very painfull for both maintainers and contributors, so we need to set some guidelines to make it smooth.

NB : These guidelines are and will always be up for discussion. Just open a ticket if anything could be improved!

### Open source guide

You can read it [here](https://opensource.guide/).

### Code quality

Please try to do the following :

- Every new piece of code requires tests. If you don't know how to do that, it's fine, but please create an issue and add a `/* TODO: write test for ...` so we don't forget about doing it.
- Write stories for new components. If you don't know how to do that, write a todo like previously said.
- Update tests / stories if you change anything
- Naming and folder structure is _really_ important. Have a look to the current code and see how it's done üòâ
- Do not reinvent the wheel : if you want to add a library like lodash instead of ramda, open a ticket first so we can discuss it.
