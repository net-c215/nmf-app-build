<p>When your data is saved on the cloud, it means it's saved on remote computers (servers). It's really nice and convenient because if you loose your computer or your phone, your data is not lost!</p>
<p>However, redundant data is not environmental friendly at all and will never be. Remember this: everytime you save data, transfer data it means CO2 emissions.</p>
<p>Servers as well as your devices needs many rare metals but also because it needs electricity to work. For the servers, it's every single day of the year with no down time, to make sure you can access your data at any time of the day. As you know, electricity production always emits CO2, even if it's solar, windmills or nuclear. Yes, there is no &quot;green&quot; energy and solar panels manufacturing pollutes a lot.</p>
<p>Therefore, the less emails you have on your mailbox, the less data you have on the cloud, the better for the environment.</p>
<h3>More data = more pollution</h3>

<p>Streaming is nice, streaming is amazing, but have you ever though about the consequences on the environement?</p>
<p>To give you an idea on how bad the streaming is, let's take an example. The size of the article text in the English Wikipedia is around <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Size_of_Wikipedia\\">20 gigabytes</a> of data in 2020. It means that everytime you watch a season of the Walking Dead in HD (1080p), you have downloaded on your computer/phone the same amount of data as the entire Wikipedia encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Same applies to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon and Youtube. Music is much smaller than a HD video but an average user consumes several songs in a day so at the end of the year, the impact of the climate is not negligeable.</p>
<p>Both music and video streaming relies on servers as well as internet infrastuctures to transport the data to you. All of this has a cost, so instead of streaming in all circomstances, try to listen to the radio, go the cinema.... Who knows, you might end up meeting real people in real life!</p>
<p>Don't forget to cancel autoplay by default, leading to unecessary streaming like Youtube is doing. In most video streaming platform, you can save this behavior in the preferences. If you can, use Peertube, a decentralized and open-source video platform, much better for the environement compared to Youtube and more ethical.</p>
<p>If you still want to use YouTube, we recomment <a href=\\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-focus/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=search\\">Youtube Focus</a>, an add-on who tries to promote a healthier watching. As said on their <a href=\\"https://github.com/Jompa14/YouTube_Focus\\">Github</a>, YouTube has one billion hours whatched daily, and it‚Äôs recommendation algorithm generates more than 70% of views. That means 700.000.000 hours every single day. What means that the greatest slice of time that people spend on YouTube isnt because they searched for something to whatch or something to learn, it is because they were sugested by YouTube's algorithm.</p>

<p>A lot of people are changing their hardware it is a bit outdated, because they want a better camera or because the battery is not working well anymore.</p>
<p>Changing equipment every year is not sustainable and it's bad for the environement. To face this issue, a Dutch company, <a href=\\"https://www.fairphone.com/\\">Fairphone</a>, is making ethical and modular phone that you can fix and upgrade yourself. It's also worth mentioning brands like OnePlus which provide software updates for many years (contrary to Samsung) helping users to use their phone longer.</p>
<p>If you are on Android, installing an alternative rom like <a href=\\"https://lineageos.org/\\">LineageOS</a> can make your old phone faster and increase its lifespan. Phones made by Google (Pixel serie) and flagship phones are usually well supported by alternative roms.</p>
<p>For laptop, you can have a look to brands like <a href=\\"https://frame.work/\\">Framework</a> and for computers it's better to buy one you can assemble, upgrade and fix yourself!</p>
<p><strong>NB:</strong> We don't do sponsored links and we encourage you to do some research and comparison before purchasing anything.</p>

<p>The most environmentally friendly product is the one that is not produced! It works for phone, computer but also for anything made by the industry like car, pen, t-shirt... Don't let the marketing fool you!</p>
